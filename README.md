## Learning Points

This project was built from scratch. 

* Mongoose is used to create a data base and set up the required document objects. Additionally these tables are populated with the initial data using the seeds.sql file.   

* The use of mongoose is required and instantiated into the variable db. 

<!-- mysql2 is then called using "const db = mysql.createConnection" with the required data in the subsequent code. Mysql2 allows the user to see and/or add to the data in the prebuilt tables.  -->

## Credits

  This application was built from scratch. I have used many of the strategies taught by the excellent instructers at the UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack coding bootcamp. In this case I used variations of methods taught in unit 18, which deals with mongoDB and mongoose npm.  Finally, I copied open source badges from Vedant Chainani at the website https://dev.to/envoy_/150-badges-for-github-pnk#contents
